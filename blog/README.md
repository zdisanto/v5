# zdisanto > blog

I was thinking about adding a blog to my website...

Below are the topics I would probably write about if I were to implement a blog feature to zdisanto.
- Intro to HTML
- Intro to CSS
- Intro to JavaScript
- Code a Google Look-a-Like with Me
- Code a Terminal Look-a-Like with Me
- 100 Days of C++
